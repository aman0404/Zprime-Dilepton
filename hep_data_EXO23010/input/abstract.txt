A search for nonresonant new physics phenomena in high-mass dilepton events produced in association with b-tagged jets is performed using the data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC at a center-of-mass energy of $13~\mathrm{TeV}$. The analysis considers two EFT-based models with 6-dimensional operators involving four-fermion contact interactions between two leptons (electrons and muons) and $\mathrm{b}$ or $\mathrm{s}$ quarks ($\mathrm{bb\ell\ell}$ and $\mathrm{bs\ell\ell}$). The analysis considers two lepton flavor combinations ($\mathrm{ee}$ and $\mu\mu$) and classifies events as having 0, 1, and $\geq 2~\mathrm{b}$-tagged jets in the final state. No significant excess is observed over the smoothly falling standard model background. Upper limits are set on the product of production cross section and branching fraction of the new physics. These translate into lower limits on the energy scale $\Lambda$ of $6.9$ to $9.0~\mathrm{TeV}$ in the $\mathrm{bb\ell\ell}$ model, depending on model parameters, and on the ratio of energy scale and coupling $\Lambda/g_{*}$ of $2.0$ to $2.6~\mathrm{TeV}$ in the $\mathrm{bs\ell\ell}$ model. The latter represent the most stringent limits on this model to date. Lepton flavor universality is also tested by comparing the dielectron and dimuon mass spectra for different $\mathrm{b}$-tagged jet multiplicities.
